# Car Price Prediction
There are only 2 files for this project. 
The first one is a csv file that should be downloaded to the same place as the ipynb file.
You should at this point be able to run through the entire file.
This data should help predict the price of a used car through the model I made. 
I will be updating the model eventually and hopefully it will have a little more accuracy in the future.
