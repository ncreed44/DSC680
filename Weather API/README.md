# Weather API
This project helps you find the weather anywhere in the United States of America. 
The first thing you need to do to be able to use it is get an API key from openweathermap.com. 
After getting your api key download the file and all you will need to do is paste your api key over my api key. 
Once this is done you should be able to look up the weather by both zip code or city and state. 
You can also choose whether you prefer Celsius or Fahrenheit. You can run it over and over again until you want to quit. 
It will give you a menu prompt if you would like to end. You get 1000 calls per day so there should be no issues with how 
many searches you do.
