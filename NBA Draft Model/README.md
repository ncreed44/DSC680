# NBA Draft Model
This model will show if a specific player is likely to be drafted. 
Some of this data was from Kaggle.
Some was pulled from the basketball reference website.
The rest of it was pulled from an API. 
I made all of the data into a CSV file.
This data should be useable after all the data is downloaded in this folder into the same location.
The user should start with milestone 2 and then go up from there.
